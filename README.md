# Word-based Information Retrieval with Apache Lucene
Example of how to use Apache Lucene for word-based information retrieval in Java.
<br/>
<h2>Description</h2>
This notebook demonstrates how to use Apache Lucene for word-based information retrieval tasks. We will cover the basics of using Lucene, including:

- Creating an index
- Adding documents to the index
- Performing searches on the index
- Updating documents in the index
- Deleting single and all elements from the index

<h2>Apache Lucene</h2>
<a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> is an open-source information retrieval library, renowned for its efficiency and versatility in full-text indexing and searching. Developed in Java, it provides a powerful framework for building search applications. Lucene employs an inverted index mechanism, where it pre-processes and stores terms along with their locations in documents, enabling rapid retrieval based on queries. It offers a wide array of functionalities including tokenization, stemming, ranking, and highlighting. Lucene's modular design allows for integration into various applications beyond search engines, such as document clustering, classification, and recommendation systems. Its robustness, scalability, and extensive documentation make it a preferred choice for researchers and developers seeking to implement high-performance search solutions.

<h2>Note on execution requirements</h2>
This Jupyter Notebook must be run with a Java kernel. Ensure that you have a Java kernel installed and selected in your Jupyter environment to execute the code cells correctly. If you don't have a Java kernel installed, you can add one using the appropriate Jupyter extensions or tools like <a href="https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava">IJava</a> which I used.
